# Bacteria_Biodiversity

## Overview

Roza has a partially completed dashboard that she needs to finish. She has a completed panel for demographic information and now needs to visualize the bacterial data for each volunteer. Specifically, her volunteers should be able to identify the top 10 bacterial species in their belly buttons. That way, if Improbable Beef identifies a species as a candidate to manufacture synthetic beef, Roza's volunteers will be able to identify whether that species is found in their navel.

## Summary


Brief explenation of what the results say and detect any trends in the data


Difficult to compare 300 to 1 on the scale.. using more of a standard scale would be beneficial.
